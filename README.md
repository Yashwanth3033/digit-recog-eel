# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition Desktop App

This desktop application recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a neural network and a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Built using **Eel**, connecting Python backend with HTML/CSS frontend via **webhooks**.
- Implements two models:
  - A basic **Neural Network (NN)**
  - A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that outperforms NN by recognizing edges and spatial features.
- **CNN achieves higher accuracy** due to its ability to detect localized patterns like strokes and edges in images.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Eel (Python + Web frontend bridge)
- HTML/CSS for UI
